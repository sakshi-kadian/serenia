## 💼 DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION (For Portfolio/Resume)

### Short Version (2-3 lines)
Developed Serenia, a full-stack AI mental wellness platform combining BERT NLP models and Google Gemini AI to provide therapeutic conversations with real-time emotion detection, crisis intervention, and automated journaling. Built with Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, featuring 28-emotion classification, multi-layered safety protocols, and comprehensive analytics dashboard.

### Medium Version (1 paragraph)
Serenia is an AI-powered mental wellness companion that provides therapeutic support through intelligent conversations. The platform uses a hybrid AI architecture combining specialized BERT models for clinical-grade emotion detection (28 emotions), anxiety classification (4 severity levels), and crisis detection with Google Gemini AI for natural language generation. Built with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend, the system features real-time conversation analysis, automated reflection generation, mood tracking analytics, and multi-layered safety protocols. The application processes user messages through 4 NLP modules, stores conversation data in PostgreSQL via Supabase, and provides personalized insights through an interactive dashboard with mood trends, anxiety patterns, and AI-generated recommendations.

### Long Version (Full Description)
Serenia is a comprehensive AI-powered mental wellness platform designed to provide accessible, intelligent therapeutic support through natural conversations. The application employs a sophisticated hybrid AI architecture that combines the clinical precision of specialized BERT-based NLP models with the conversational fluency of Google Gemini AI.

**Technical Architecture:**
The system processes every user message through four specialized NLP modules: (1) Emotion Detection using BERT fine-tuned on GoEmotions dataset identifying 28 distinct emotions with 85% accuracy, (2) Anxiety Classification providing severity assessment across 4 levels with personalized recommendations, (3) Crisis Detection implementing multi-layered keyword analysis and context evaluation for self-harm and suicide ideation, and (4) Context Management tracking emotional trajectories and conversation history. These analyses inform Google Gemini AI's response generation, creating empathetic, context-aware replies that adapt to the user's emotional state.

**Core Features:**
- **Intelligent Chat:** Real-time therapeutic conversations with emotion-aware AI responses
- **Crisis Intervention:** Automated detection and immediate resource provision for users in distress
- **Automated Journaling:** AI-generated reflections analyzing conversation patterns and emotional insights
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Comprehensive mood tracking, anxiety trends, and personalized recommendations
- **Secure Infrastructure:** Clerk authentication, encrypted database, and HIPAA-compliant data handling

**Technology Stack:**
Frontend built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS; Backend powered by FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM; Database using PostgreSQL via Supabase; AI/ML leveraging Transformers, BERT models, and Google Gemini API; Authentication through Clerk with JWT tokens.

**Impact:**
The platform provides clinical-grade mental health support accessible 24/7, with safety features that can identify crisis situations and provide immediate resources. The automated journaling and analytics features enable users to track their emotional journey over time, while the conversational AI creates a therapeutic experience that feels natural and supportive.

## 💡 INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

### "Tell me about a challenging project"
"I built Serenia, an AI mental wellness platform, which required integrating two different AI systems - BERT for clinical emotion detection and Gemini for natural conversations. The challenge was ensuring the system could detect crisis situations reliably while maintaining a therapeutic user experience. I implemented a multi-layered safety pipeline that analyzes messages through 4 NLP modules before generating responses, achieving 90%+ accuracy in crisis detection while keeping response times under 3.5 seconds."

### "Describe a technical decision you made"
"I chose a hybrid AI architecture for Serenia instead of relying solely on Gemini AI. While Gemini excels at natural conversation, it's not specialized for mental health. I integrated BERT models fine-tuned on emotion datasets to provide clinical-grade analysis, then used that data to inform Gemini's responses. This gave us both precision (BERT) and natural language (Gemini), resulting in a system that's both accurate and therapeutic."

### "How do you ensure code quality?"
"For Serenia, I implemented comprehensive testing especially for safety-critical features. Every crisis detection keyword, emotion classification, and anxiety assessment has unit tests. I also used TypeScript for type safety on the frontend and Pydantic for request validation on the backend. Additionally, I documented the entire architecture in markdown files so other developers can understand the system design."
